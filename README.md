# code_scrapbook

## What is my motivation?
This is a progress journal for all of my code.

I intend to use this to improve my future employability skills, as well as improve my programming skills in general.


## What is here currently?

Most of the basics of c, for easy reference and usually a small description to go with it.

Some small projects in raylib, a game development library. 

## Resources I have used


I used www.cprogramming.com to learn the basics of c.


I used www.raylib.com/examples.html to reverse engineer the examples and find out how they work.

## License

To protect me and other possible users of this code, I do not want any of my code to be made as closed source then profited off of. I do not want to give my code as a "gift" but rather "share" it as long as it is used nicely. Please see the COPYING file for the license as required, it is GPLv3.
