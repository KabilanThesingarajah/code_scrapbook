# code_scrapbook

## What is my motivation?
This is a progress journal for all of my code.

I intend to use this to improve my future employability skills, as well as improve my programming skills in general.


## What is here currently?

My current commits are about learning web development using a udemy course.

Most of the basics of c, for easy reference and usually a small description to go with it.

Some small projects in raylib, a game development library. 



## Resources I have used


I used www.cprogramming.com to learn the basics of c.


I used www.raylib.com/examples.html to reverse engineer the examples and find out how they work.


I used https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/ to learn basic html css and javascript (although they teach back-end and much more)

I used https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/ to further learn web development
